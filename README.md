# basic-flask-app-setup
Tired of setting up flask for every project ? Fork this.

It's a basic setup for any flask project you want to embark on

Creates a basic flask app and everything else is up to you, just run:

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
`export FLASK_APP=app`
`export FLASK_ENV=development`

or

`set FLASK_APP=app`
`set FLASK_ENV=development`

for Linux.

Good luck.
